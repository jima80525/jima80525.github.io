Title: About
----------------------

My name is Jim and I'm a well-seasoned (read: OLD) developer who has spent many years developing in C-like languages: C, C++, Java, Lua, Python, Perl, and a few others. Much of my experience is in embedded systems, most recently doing embedded Linux products.

In my spare time I like to bike and snowboard, though rarely at the same time.

I'm currently working on the image processing pipeline for video security cameras as my day job. I also am an editor and writer for [Real Python](https://realpython.com/team/janderson/) which lets me work on my writing and connects me with a bunch of fun people!

## What's this blog about?

In this blog, I plan on writing about Python, C/C++, debugging, office politics, and whatever is striking my fancy at the time. I have no planned schedule for posts, it's really whenever the mood strikes me. Really, this is just an outlet for some writing that doesn't fit the requirements for a Real Python article or is more about soft skills than technical ones.

## What if I have a question or comment?

Feel free to hit the contact links if you want to comment or discuss anything I write about here. I'll try to get back to you, provided you're not shouting.

It'll be fun to see where this leads!
